# Chapter 2 Exercises

# Exercise 1
a = "All "
b = ' work'
c = ' and'
d = ' no'
e = ' play'
f = ' makes'
g = ' Jack'
h = ' a'
i = ' dull'
j = ' boy'

Answer = a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j
print(Answer)


# Exercise 2
6 * (1-2)


# Exercise 3
# Nothing! A comment does not affect the code at all! It just guides the reader what each line is supposed to do.


# Exercise 4
bruce = 6
print(bruce + 4)


# Exercise 5
# Calculates final amount using compound interest formula

P = float(input("Enter the initial amount:"))
r = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate as a decimal:"))

n = int(input("Enter the amount of times the interest is compounded per year:"))

t = int(input("Enter the number of years:"))

Amount = P * (1 + r/n) ** n * t
print(Amount)


# Exercise 6
Invalid syntax, because the answer is undefined. Any number divided by 0 is undefined, and so is its remainder

# Exercise 7

# Code that prints 51 hours from 2:00

remaining_hours = 51 % 12

Answer = remaining_hours + 2

print("The answer is " + str(Answer) + " o'clock")


# Exercise 8
hour = int(input("Enter the hour:"))
hours_to_add = int(input("Enter the number of hours to add:"))
if hours_to_add >= 12:
   new_time = hour + (hours_to_add % 12)
else:
   new_time = hour + hours_to_add
print(new_time)
