# Chapter 1 exercises
# Exercise 1 
 I like to read books a lot, but not as much as I like to watch movies.
# Incorrect syntax, because the statement is not written as a print statement

print("i lik to read books a laut but not as much as i like to watch movies ")
# Correct syntax, but spelling and punctuation is wrong


# Exercise 2
# addition = +
# subtraction = -
# equivalency = ==
# multiplication = *
# division = /
# exponents = **

# Exercise 3
# Print("3") generates invalid syntax, because Print is not a word. print is the correct word that must be used. When you spell a keyword wrong, or capitalize it, it generates an invalid syntax. Official line: "name Print not defined"

# Exercise 4
# When you just type "hello", the computer comes back with the exact same thing you typed. The quotation marks only disappear when you add the print

# Exercise 5
# Cheese is not defined, because the variable hasn't been defined as any value. That's like saying x + 3 = y, and never finding x or y.

# Exercise 6
# For 6+4*9, the computer gives you 42, because the computer uses order of operations. When I executed the same expression using a print statement this time, the computer took a bit longer to process the results.
